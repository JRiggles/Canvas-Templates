#### An Aseprite extension
*current release: v1.0.0*
(https://sudo-whoami.itch.io/canvas-templates)*

## Latest Changes

##
This [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org) extension provides predifined canvas size templates for new Aseprite files. Several template sizes are included for common aspect ratios, game consoles, and more!

You can also edit the built-in "templates.json" file to add your own template categories and sizes. This file will be copied to your default Aseprite scripts folder when you use the extension for the first time.
